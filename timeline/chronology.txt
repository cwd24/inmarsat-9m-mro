  "Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn ...
  said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar "was able to detect a
  signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the
  direction opposite from the MH370 plane," back toward Kuala
  Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a
  Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was
  infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.
  ... He said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected
  the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last
  detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.
  ... Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday
  that the country's northern radar did not detect it."

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnqlOEAp60
  "As you know, on the eleventh we shared with the investigation a
  possible North-South path based on the single hourly pings we got
  off the aircraft.  Over the intervening days our engineers have been
  looking at modelling the signals coming off of the plane via the
  network and comparing it other proven Malaysian triple-seven flights
  on our network and concluding whether the northern path was valid or
  not.

  In building up that data they then gave it to others in the UK space
  industry to peer-review.  They did that, and they also went to
  Boeing to make sure they had the right assumptions about autopilot
  speed and the performance of the aircraft, which they did, and then
  built a pattern that was sent to the investigation yesterday.

  This is completely unusual, Inmarsat has been doing the global
  Maritime distress service for thirty-four years now.  We were
  founded on the UN charter to do that.

  This is the first time we've ever been asked to find something, with
  just a single signal once an hour.  It's really a great tribute to
  our scientific team that they've managed to achieve this. ..."
