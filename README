Paul Sladen 2E0PHS <9m-mro@paul.sladen.org> - 27 May 2014

Tool to recover a usable CSV logfile from the redacted AES records
published by Inmarsat and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation
on 27 May 2014 relating to the disappearance of 9M-MRO.

This programme is hereby placed in the public domain, and may be
distributed and modified without limit, for any purpose.

  ./pdf-to-csv.py > inmarsat-su-log-redacted.csv

It calls out to 'pdftotext' which is in the 'poppler-utils' package
in Debian/Ubuntu.  The program was developed under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

This is written as a script (instead of manual conversion) so that it
can be repeatedly run in a deterministic manner: meaning that the
results can be peer-reviewed by the wider academic community.

The enclosed .csv file has a sample of the output for reference
purposes.  There appears to be no clear licence on the original
dataset.

In addition, a patchset restores additional data transcribed from the
CNN videos showing the unredacted SU logs.

MH370*Track.py are tools originally written by Sean McLeod for
integrating possible direct solution (without mid-sector turns).

Historical element sets for 1996-020A are in 'sat23839.txt'.
