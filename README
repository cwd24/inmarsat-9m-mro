Paul Sladen 2E0PHS <9m-mro@paul.sladen.org> - 27 May 2014

Tool to recover a usable CSV logfile from the redacted AES records
published by Inmarsat and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation
on 27 May 2014 relating to the disappearance of 9M-MRO.

This programme is hereby placed in the public domain, and may be
distributed and modified without limit, for any purpose.

  ./pdf-to-csv.py > inmarsat-su-log-redacted.csv

This is written as a script so that it can be repeatedly run
in a deterministic manner, and so the results can be peer-reviewed
by the wider academic community.

The enclosed .csv file has a sample of the output for reference
purposes.  There appears to be no clear licence on the original
dataset.
