Azaa Dana

The "Aaza Dana" is a Kuwait-registered sailing vessel that was
transiting north-west of Sumatra on its way eastwards to Thailand.
One potential eye-witness (Kate Tee) to the occurrence of 9M-MRO was
on-watch at the time, and recorded their observations of seeing
an aircraft in the vicinity operating in an unusual manner:

Vessel

No AIS transponder was fitted, the vessel does not appear in
the ITU MARS database, and no MMSI appears to have been assigned:

GPS Track

Track information has been provided by the owners Katherine Tee and
Marc Horn in a Mapsource/Garmin ".gdb" format.

The plausible timings of interest align to before/around when the gybe
occurred.  This is a South->North course, a 270-degree turn to port,
followed by a West->East course.

Overall the speed of the vessel is extremely slow (2.5 knots before
gybe, 1.5 knots after gybe), and so can be treated as a single point
location for the period during which an aircraft would generally have
taken to cross the field of view.

The ".gdb" file contained some approximate working calculations for
separate observations of bright lights, and sunrise/sunset timings.
Part of a rail journey around Amsterdam is also present, which would
indicate the use of a portable handheld GPS unit rather than a fixed
GPS installation.


Timezone

The GPS logs themselves are likely to be in UTC, although there has
been some uncertainty about the presentation timezone used, or
configured, in the laptop-based Mapsource display software.

The ideal way of confirming or removing any timezone shift would be to
correlate a point on the track to a corresponding Satellite AIS
pick-up, and then to shift the remaining points in time, if required.


Heading

Temporal shifting would make very little difference to the recorded
position of the vessel during the period of interest.  The proximity
of the turning manoeuvre would shift the recorded true course of the
vessel (and therefore the heading as a factor of wind), and therefore
the visual frame of reference for the documented observations.
