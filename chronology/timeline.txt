  "Chris Mclaughlin ... our customer SITA, ... rang up and said "Can
  we have the data off the plane that you've got?" And we said "Yeah,
  of course." And that was the end of our involvement. We sent the
  information, and it comprised really the first hour and a half. It
  was very sad the plane was missing, but not our job."

  "Chris Mclaughlin ... On Sunday afternoon, one of our engineers, who
  had been involved five years earlier with the Air France loss, felt
  that we should look at the network further to see if there was
  anything else that we could offer because nobody had any idea. He
  found that the aircraft was still sending out signals seven and a
  half hours after it had vanished. We kept delving, and by Monday
  morning it was absolutely clear that the aircraft had been powered
  up for a number of hours after it had gone missing. And there were
  implications for this."

  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579434653903086282

  Original: "investigators and national security officials
  believe the plane flew for a total of five hours,
  based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from
  the Boeing Co. 777's engines as part of a routine maintenance and
  monitoring program."

  Ammended: "investigators
  believe the plane flew for a total of up to five hours,
  according to these people,
  based on analysis of signals sent by the Boeing 777's
  satellite-communication link designed to automatically transmit the
  status of certain onboard systems to the ground. … These
  transmissions did not include data,"

  Explanation: "An earlier version of this article and an accompanying
  graphic incorrectly said investigators based their suspicions on
  signals from monitoring systems embedded in the plane's Rolls-Royce
  PLC engines and described that process."

  signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the
  direction opposite from the MH370 plane," back toward Kuala
  Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a
  Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was
  infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.
  ... He said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected
  the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last
  detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.
  ... Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday

  "As you know, on the eleventh we shared with the investigation a
  possible North-South path based on the single hourly pings we got
  off the aircraft.  Over the intervening days our engineers have been
  looking at modelling the signals coming off of the plane via the
  network and comparing it other proven Malaysian triple-seven flights
  on our network and concluding whether the northern path was valid or
  not.

  In building up that data they then gave it to others in the UK space
  industry to peer-review.  They did that, and they also went to
  Boeing to make sure they had the right assumptions about autopilot
  speed and the performance of the aircraft, which they did, and then
  built a pattern that was sent to the investigation yesterday.

  This is completely unusual, Inmarsat has been doing the global
  Maritime distress service for thirty-four years now.  We were
  founded on the UN charter to do that.

  This is the first time we've ever been asked to find something, with
  just a single signal once an hour.  It's really a great tribute to
  our scientific team that they've managed to achieve this. ..."

  "Only three stations are identified: the IMS hydrophone arrays H01
  and H08, and the Geoscope seismic station AIS.  Analysis of the data
  from these stations shows an interesting arrival on H01 that has
  some interference from an Antarctic ice event, large amplitude
  repeating signals at H08 that obscure any possible arrivals, and
  large amplitude chaotic noise at AIS that obscures any arrivals at
  lower frequencies while the low sample rate at AIS precludes any
  analysis at higher frequencies of interest.  The results are
  therefore rather inconclusive but may point to a more southerly
  impact location within the overall Indian Ocean search region."

  "The IMS data are available from the CTBTO located in Vienna,
  Austria.  The data from AIS are available at the IRIS DMC located
  in Seattle, Washington, USA."

  "The final alignment of the first arrivals produces a DOA of 246.9°
  (with the phase velocity fixed at 1.46 km/s).  The source for this
  arrival would then be WSW of the array, in the general direction of
  the region in which MH370 may have impacted the ocean, and has an
  arrival time that could be consistent as well."
