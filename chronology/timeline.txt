  "Chris Mclaughlin ... our customer SITA, ... rang up and said "Can
  we have the data off the plane that you've got?" And we said "Yeah,
  of course." And that was the end of our involvement. We sent the
  information, and it comprised really the first hour and a half. It
  was very sad the plane was missing, but not our job."

  "Within hours of Flight 370's disappearance on March 8, Inmarsat
  started searching for clues. What little data it had on the short
  flight before it disappeared was provided to SITA, a Swiss aviation

  "Chris Mclaughlin ... On Sunday afternoon, one of our engineers, who
  had been involved five years earlier with the Air France loss, felt
  that we should look at the network further to see if there was
  anything else that we could offer because nobody had any idea. He
  found that the aircraft was still sending out signals seven and a
  half hours after it had vanished. We kept delving, and by Monday
  morning it was absolutely clear that the aircraft had been powered
  up for a number of hours after it had gone missing. And there were
  implications for this."

  "Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn ...
  said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar "was able to detect a
  signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the
  direction opposite from the MH370 plane," back toward Kuala
  Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a
  Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was
  infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.
  ... He said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected
  the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last
  detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.
  ... Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday
  that the country's northern radar did not detect it."

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnqlOEAp60
  "As you know, on the eleventh we shared with the investigation a
  possible North-South path based on the single hourly pings we got
  off the aircraft.  Over the intervening days our engineers have been
  looking at modelling the signals coming off of the plane via the
  network and comparing it other proven Malaysian triple-seven flights
  on our network and concluding whether the northern path was valid or
  not.

  In building up that data they then gave it to others in the UK space
  industry to peer-review.  They did that, and they also went to
  Boeing to make sure they had the right assumptions about autopilot
  speed and the performance of the aircraft, which they did, and then
  built a pattern that was sent to the investigation yesterday.

  This is completely unusual, Inmarsat has been doing the global
  Maritime distress service for thirty-four years now.  We were
  founded on the UN charter to do that.

  This is the first time we've ever been asked to find something, with
  just a single signal once an hour.  It's really a great tribute to
  our scientific team that they've managed to achieve this. ..."
