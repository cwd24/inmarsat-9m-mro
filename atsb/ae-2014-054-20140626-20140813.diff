+The reason for the partial compensation is that the Perth EAFC receiver was not designed to
+handle the case where the reference Pilot signal is transmitted from a different hemisphere to that
+in which it is received. In the MH370 situation the reference Pilot signal was transmitted from the
+Burum GES in the Netherlands, and received at Perth, resulting in the equipment only being able
+to partially remove the C Band Doppler component.
+The EAFC receiver at Perth is an old unit that is unable to accept negative latitude values to
+service southern hemisphere locations as described. Inmarsat operates the unit in such a manner
+that it reduces the effect of the C Band Doppler rather than removing it completely. Such an
+approach is perfectly serviceable for communications use.
+An algorithm was used which enabled determination of the frequency translation variations
+applied in the GES due to the EAFC receiver. However this is of limited utility to the analysis as
+there is still the uncertainty related to the translation frequency applied by the satellite.
+Inmarsat compared the measured frequency of the Burum LC Pilot signal received at the Perth
+GES (after passing through the satellite and the Perth receive chain) with the frequency that would
+have been expected due to the effect of Doppler shift due to satellite movement. This determined
+the combined effect of satellite translation frequency and GES EAFC frequency variation. This
+combined factor was used to determine the ‘Satellite and EAFC Effect’ in the BFO calculations.
